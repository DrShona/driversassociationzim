          <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
          <p>
        
            Drivers Association of Zimbabwe is a new non-profit making organization and professional association of drivers in the transport industry. It was formed by a policeman and 14 drivers who are recognized in the transport industry. Recognized in the sense that they won awards in the Driver  of the Year Competitions organized by the Traffic Safety Council of  Zimbabwe. Some of these drivers even  participated at the World Competitions including the last one held in Finland from 23-31 August 2016. The mission of D.A.Z is to self-regulate member drivers in the transport industry, promote road safety , protect lives and property from incompetent and unethical drivers.

          </p>
          
          <h1> BACKGROUND</h1>
          
          
            <p>
        The President of the Association now retired to focus on road safety whilst he was still serving   in the ZRP and attached to the Traffic Branch noticed the following;<br><br>
            i.	Driving is free for all and this resulted in the transport industry facing many challenges like high rates of accidents, robberies, thefts, murderers, rapes etc.<br><br>
            ii.	Traditionally world over, road safety has been placed on the individual road user with focus on encouraging good behavior, via licensing, training, publicity and enforcement.<br><br>
            iii.	It is not the number of law enforcement officers in the street that brings traffic law enforcement but most traffic management issues can be done at the background.
            So the key to ‘’taming the traffic jungle’’ in the transport industry is to plan with the community and not plan for the community.
            The only way to plan with the community is for driving to become a profession for the same reasons law and medicine became professions : each requires practitioners to have a specialized body of knowledge, a code of conduct and self-regulation by knowledgeable professionals to assure competency and protect the public. This led to the formation of the association.
          </p>
          
          <h1> VISION</h1>
          
          
            <p>
            To be the leading professional association in Zimbabwe.
          </p>
          
          <h1> MISSION</h1>
          
          
            <p>
            To  promote the practice of safe, ethical and competent professional drivers in  the transport industry.
          </p>
          
          <h1> SYNOPSIS OF ACTIVITIES</h1>
          
          
            <p>
            The purpose of regulation is to ensure that professionals practice in a safe, competent and ethical manner. Regulation is all of the activities directed toward this end.<br><br>
            The regulation of drivers will be done through self-regulation and external regulation.<br><br>
            Under self-regulation, the association is now recognized by the Government through the Licence it was issued by the Minister of Justice and Parliamentary Affairs on the 23rd of May 2017.
            Under external regulation the profession is regulated by the Government through its agencies like ZRP, VED, and TSCZ etc. Both methods will complement each other.

          </p>
          
          <h2> SELF REGULATION</h2>
          
          
            <p>
            Acknowledges    that a profession is in the best position to regulate its members because their specialized body of knowledge makes external regulation difficult and impractical.<br><br>
            The main things the association does to self-regulate can be described under five main areas;<br><br>
            i.	Professional register;<br>
            ii.	Code of ethics;<br>
            iii.Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programs;<br>
            iv.	Professional Portfolio;<br>
            v.	Disciplinary measures.<br><br>
            
            
                
            </p>
            <h3> 1.	PROFESSIONAL REGISTER</h3>
            <p>
                The association will maintain a professional register (list/database)of individual members who are liable to the association’s code of conduct. The members also commit to keeping their skills and knowledge up-to-date through the association’s CPD programs.
              </p>
              
            <h3>2. CODE OF ETHICS/CONDUCT</h3>
            <p>
                D.A.Z.’s members are accountable to the association’s code of ethics which is a public statement of the values we hold and we determine to be acceptable professional conduct.<br>
                As a self-governing profession, the association is mandated by legislation to establish such codes and to discipline members who fail to adhere to ethical standards.

              </p>
              
              <h3>3. CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CPD) PROGRAMS </h3>
            <p>
                Is the action we take to maintain, update and grow the knowledge and skills required for our professional role? As the name suggests, it is ongoing commitment lasting for as long as we remain within our profession.<br>
                It will be the responsibility of the association to establish a program of continuing professional development to ensure that members maintain a high level of competence in their professional conduct.The responsibility then falls to each member to continuously improve his/her skills in the profession.<br>
                It will be provided by industry specialist like VED (retest) and TSCZ (Defensive driving) etc.<br>
                Attending  conferences, seminars, workshops, reading relevant articles and magazines all counts towards CPD.


              </p>
              
              <h3>4. PROFESSIONAL PORTFOLIO</h3>
            <p>
                Is a tool judiciously and carefully crafted to appropriately showcase the work of a professional while providing evidence of career growth.<br><br>
                The association will put in place professional portfolio for each and every member in which all the information pertaining to members will be filled, e.g;<br><br>
                <br>i.	Continuing education / workshops completed;
                <br>ii.	Letters of references; 
                <br>iii.	Certificates;
                <br>iv.	Awards and honors;
                <br>v.	Work experience / history etc.



              </p>
          <h3>5.	DISCIPLINARY  MEASURES</h3>
        <p>The association will receive and manage complaints against members and order appropriate remedial or disciplinary action as required.<br>
        These are some of the ways the association fulfills its mandate of public protection through the activities of self-regulation.
